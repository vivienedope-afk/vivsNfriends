# Remove Back Button from Nav Bar

## Task: Remove the back button from the nav bar on every page of the website.

## Pages to Update:
- [x] home.php - Remove back button that links to 'index.php'
- [x] account.php - Remove back button with goBack() function
- [x] calendar.php - Remove back button that links to 'home.php'
- [x] amenities.php - Remove back button that links to 'home.php'

## Admin Pages (No changes needed):
- admin/dashboard.php - No back button present
- admin/residents.php - No back button present

## Notes:
- Back button is a `<button class="back-button">` element in the nav bar
- Admin pages already lack the back button, so no modifications required
